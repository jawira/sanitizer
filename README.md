Add sanitizer attributes to your class:

class User {

    #[Sanitizer\Capitalize]
    public string $name;
}
```

Call `Sanitizer::sanitize` method to apply sanitizers:

```php
use Jawira\Sanitizer\Sanitizer;

$sanitizer = new Sanitizer();
$user = new User();
$user->name = ' BOB ';

$sanitizer->sanitize($user);
echo $user->name; // 'Bob'
```
